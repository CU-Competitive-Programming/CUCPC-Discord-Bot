**Here are all the specs for the game environment set up for season 2!**

- In every turn you will play **5 matches** against your opponent.

- You will play in **2 small maps, 2 big maps and once in the default size map** every turn.

  The maps are chosen randomly from :

  ```
    Small :
      "216", "144" ( -10% size from default )
      "204", "136" ( -15% size from default )
      "192", "128" ( -20% size form default )

    Big :
      "264", "176" ( +10% size from default )
      "276", "192" ( +15% size from default )
      "288", "192" ( +20% size form default )

    Default :
      “240”, “160”```

- The map seed isn't completely random, for every match you play we choose a random one between : **2350513674** - **2350513694** ( 20 different seeds ).

- The goal of these settings is to have **very little rushing**, rewarding the players that can get the planets and choose their strategy properly.

- The number of **planets is increased** and their **resources are limited**, nevertheless there is **regeneration** for ships that are docked ( you might wanna consider creating some function that makes the ship use planets as shelters ).

- The **attack of the ships is lower**, the **range** of the weapon is lower too and the **cool down time** of the weapon has increased.

- Playing in different map sizes hopefully will give a much more fair result of the battles, **rewarding players that can play well in both big and small maps.**
